    trained on historical loan application data to predict outcomes based on user data, reducing the need for
     physical bank visits. Users can conveniently apply for loans and receive instant feedback via an online platform. 
     The project integrates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface, with Python and SQL for back-end 
     processing and data management. It ensures data privacy with secure login and registration functionalities and 
     features a comprehensive loan application form and results page for predictions. Developed with tools like VS 
     Code and Jupyter Notebook, this system enhances the efficiency and accessibility of the loan application process 
     for both applicants and financial institutions.",

Built using Python, Flask, and MongoDB, this system combines user-friendly features with advanced natural language processing techniques to deliver accurate and relevant legal responses. The application utilizes a pre-existing dataset containing legal queries, responses, applicable legal articles, and usage information. By implementing the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) model and cosine similarity, the system efficiently matches user queries with the most suitable responses.

        Users can register and log in to the system, ensuring that their sessions are secure and personalized. The registration process involves securely hashing passwords using the werkzeug library, and the login system checks these hashed passwords for authentication. Once logged in, users can submit their legal queries through the interface, and the system returns the most relevant response along with details of the applicable legal articles. The application also keeps a history of user queries, allowing users to revisit previous searches easily.",
